# Learning Medical Image Denoising with Deep Dynamic Residual Attention Network

A fork from "sharif-apu/MID-DRAN", modified input data structure to allow the use of pre-existing noisy data, as an alternative to adding noise during processing.

This is the official implementation of state-of-the-art medical image denoising method titled as **"Dynamic Residual Attention Network (DRAN)"**. **[[Click Here](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/8/12/2192/pdf)]** to download the full paper (in PDF).  </br>

**Figure:** </em> Performance of existing medical image denoising methods in removing image noise at **sigma = 50**. The existing denoising methods immensely failed in addressing a substantial amount of noise removal and susceptible to produce artefacts. (a) Noisy input. (b) Result obtained by BM3D. (c) Result

**Table:** Quantitative comparison between different medical image denoising methods. Results are
obtained by calculating the mean on two evaluation metrics (PSNR and SSIM). In all comparing categories, the proposed
method illustrates the consistency and outperforms the existing denoising methods. </br>



# Prerequisites
```
Python 3.8
CUDA 10.1 + CuDNN
pip
Virtual environment (optional)
```

# Installation
**Please consider using a virtual environment to continue the installation process.**
```
git clone https://github.com/sharif-apu/MID-DRAN.git
cd MID-DRAN
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

# Testing
**DRAN can be inferenced with pretrained weights and default setting as follows:** </br>
```python main.py -i``` </br>

A few testing images are provided in a sub-directory under testingImages (i.e., testingImages/sampleImages/)</br>
In such occasion, denoised image(s) will be available in modelOutput/sampleImages/. </br>

**To inference with custom setting execute the following command:**</br>
```python main.py -i -s path/to/inputImages -d path/to/outputImages -ns=sigma(s)``` </br>
Here,**-ns** specifies the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution (i.e., -ns=15, 25, 50),**-s** specifies the root directory of the source images
 (i.e., testingImages/), and **-d** specifies the destination root (i.e., modelOutput/).

# Training
**To train with your own dataset execute:**</br>
```python main.py -ts -e X -b Y```
To specify your trining images path, go to mainModule/config.json and update "trainingImagePath" entity. </br>You can specify the number of epoch with **-e** flag (i.e., -e 5) and number of images per batch with **-b** flag (i.e., -b 24).</br>

**For transfer learning execute:**</br>
```python main.py -tr -e -b ```

# Others
**Check model configuration:**</br>
```python main.py -ms``` </br>
**Create new configuration file:**</br>
```python main.py -c```</br>
**Update configuration file:**</br>
```python main.py -u```</br>
**Overfitting testing** </br>
```python main.py -to ```</br>
